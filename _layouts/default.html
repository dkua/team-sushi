      There has been a rising demand for sushi dishes across the globe for its taste and aesthetics. Looking at Sushiâ€™s history, Sushi, surprisingly, was not of Japanese Origin. According to some sources, Sushi was traced as far back in China and from there was able to move to Japan. The farthest evidence we have in tracing the roots of Sushi dates back to the 4th century found in the Chinese dictionary (Mouritsen, 15). Sushi was officially found to have been introduced in Japan in the 9th century.  However, its origins is questionable whether it is originally made from China and made its way to Japan. The earliest methods of making sushi involved the fish being fermented for as long as three year before it is consumed. One of the sushi that exemplifies this method of production is known as the Funa-zushi located in Lake Biwa, Japan. The fish is caught fresh from the lake at the end of the summer, salted, layered in cooked rice, placed inside a wooden box under pressured with a heavy rock to be fermented for at least half a year or longer. When it is served, the layer of rice is discarded except for the fish. The fish is placed on a designed plate for aesthetic purposes and sliced to display the insides of the fermented fish. Portions sizes were bigger as well because the fermentation is made in bulks. Sushi production and how we conceive it now changed over the course of time and this is because of the innovations and events that happened in history that contributed to its evolution.
