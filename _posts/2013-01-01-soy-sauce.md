Some sources say that its origin was traced back to China. One of the myths behind the history of soy sauce is that it was made when a "worker lay down to rest under a vat where soybeans were being fermented to make miso" where the soy sauce came out of the vat's cracks. The same myth applies to how soy sauce is actually made where it is fermented at a certain temperature and pasteurized resulting to soy sauce.
