Through immigration, we see people bring their culture and knowledge of the cuisine to the place that they are migrating into. Often times, these places does not have the ingredients they are familiar with. What happens is that their knowledge of the cuisine became hybridized with the ingredients available to them. In this documentary video by Andrew Zimmern, Hirizaka Tojo was able to introduced sushi to a conservative white populous by incorporating ingredients the local people are familiar with in the cuisine he is more familiar in making which is sushi. He was also able to hide the fishy taste that is usually not appealing to Europeans.
