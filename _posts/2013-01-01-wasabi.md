Survivors who were named Heike was said to have gathered wasabi in the wild as a seasoning for raw yamame (a kind of trout), and raw venison. The identity of these survivors were said to be noble samurai who were familiar with the life and culture of Kyoto. There are two ways of preparing wasabi. In preparing powdered wasabi, place powder in a container desired and dissolve the wasabi powder in little water or rice vinegar. Mix till you reach a paste like consistency. Let the mixture rest for 5-10 minutes to release the flavours. In preparing fresh wasabi from root you would need to grate the wasabi into a pulp on a grater (oroshi-gane). Wasabi is desired for getting rid of the after taste of the fish and also helps produce saliva that aids with appetite. (Real Wasabi, 2005)
