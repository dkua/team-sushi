Rice vinegar is one of the major turning points that changed how sushi is made. With the creation of rice vinegar, it hastened the fermentation period from how it was before which was a year to three years to how it is now where sushi is prepared in a couple of minutes. The production of rice vinegar rapidly increased in Kyoto, modern day Tokyo, during the Edo period (1603-1867) (Mouritsen, 15). The shogunate moved from Kyoto to Edo (Tokyo) where the occurrences gave rise to the increase in production of rice vinegar. The creation of rice vinegar allowed for the hastening of the fermentation process of sushi which gives people more sushi available. Various types of sushi were created which happened during the rise of rice vinegar production. These sushi are: nama-zushi, haya-zushi, hako-zushi, and the one we know of now is the nigiri-zushi. Sushi is sought after for its taste and the flavor it gives through the fish and the rice. With the rise of vinegar production, how sushi was made evolved to how we conceive them today all because the method of how it is created was shortened and made easier. This also contributed in a way how sushi is presented, with a small rice ball and raw fish or meat on top. One of the condiments that enriches the flavor is soy sauce.
