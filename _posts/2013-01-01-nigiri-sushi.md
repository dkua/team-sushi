The rising merchant class also meant the rising sushi business during this time where there was a rising fish demand and also a fruitful resources for fish (Ashkenazi and Jacob, 10).  Ever since the second World War, the serving size became smaller as there was a scarcity of food available to feed everyone. The transformation came from how it was made where it used to be a big ball of rice with at least three pieces of sushi on top to a small ball of rice with a piece of fish on top which is, as stated, Nigiri-sushi. The small serving of sushi today became the standard size of serving sushi.
