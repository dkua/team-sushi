The rising merchant class also meant the rising sushi business during this time where there was a rising fish demand and also a fruitful resources for fish (Ashkenazi and Jacob, 10).  Ever since the second World War, the serving size became smaller as there was a scarcity of food available to feed everyone. The transformation came from how it was made where it used to be a big ball of rice with at least three pieces of sushi on top. This was known as the Tokyo style sushi made during the Edo Period. This type of Sushi were sold on street stands and eaten in public after the customer has bought it. It transformed  to a small ball of rice with a piece of fish on top which is, as stated, nigiri-sushi. The small serving of sushi today became the standard size of serving sushi.
