Sushi as it was before, it started as the fermentation and preservation of fish guts called Ki/Shi. here has been a rising demand for sushi dishes across the globe for its taste and aesthetics. Looking at Sushiâ€™s history, Sushi, surprisingly, was not of Japanese Origin. According to some sources, Sushi was traced as far back in China and from there was able to move to Japan. The farthest evidence we have in tracing the roots of Sushi dates back to the 4th century found in the Chinese dictionary (Mouritsen, 15).
