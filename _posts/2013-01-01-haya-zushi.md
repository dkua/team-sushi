In Matsumoto Yoshiichiâ€™s  studies, he discovered that rice vinegar tenderized the fish and at the same time give the rice this distinct taste (Mouritsen, 16). To prepare it, you have to cook the rice, add rice vinegar to the cooked rice to shorten fermentation period, and place the rice and the fish in layers to ferment it in the course of 24 hours. Consume it immediately after it is served.
