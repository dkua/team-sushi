Production of rice vinegar grew rapidly in Japan at the start of the Edo period (1603-1867). The shogunate moved from Kyoto to Edo (Tokyo) where the occurrences gave rise to the increase in production of rice vinegar. By adding rice vinegar to the cooked rice it was possible to shorten the fermentation period. The process of making sushi still relates to how sushi was made before which is by fermenting them in a wooden box under pressure by heavy stones (NHK World, 2014).
