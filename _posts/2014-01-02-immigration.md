A decade after the Second World War, there has been an increase of Japanese in America thus bringing in more cultural influence such as sushi. At the same time, so is the sushi evolution. As more Japanese immigration into America, their cultures and identity begins to increase as well. With controversies of eating raw fish in America, Japanese chefs would replace them with Western ingredients creating new sushi rolls. The California Roll is a perfect example of a sushi evolution and cultural diversity as it uses California’s avocados and either cooked crab meat or fake crab meat (blended cooked fish meat). The roll is also known today as an “inside out roll,” as it was created this way so that the seaweed would be hidden. Another fusion sushi created in America would be the Philadelphia Roll. These rolls substitutes raw ingredients with smoke salmon and Philadelphia's famous cream cheese and still a popular item in America. Many of these rolls are influenced less by Tokyo and instead more directly by trends in Los Angeles, New York, and London. Japanese immigration has also allowed chefs to transfer knowledge and skills to one another easier due to the small number of Japanese in Western cities at the time.
