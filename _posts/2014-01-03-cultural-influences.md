It wasn’t all easy for sushi to be accepted in Japan. During the 531-580 C.E. 
When Buddhism spread to Japan, eating meat was restricted which lowered consumption of sushi in Japan. Preference for vegetable became reinforced as a substitute for meat (Ashkenazi and Jacob, 7). However, this changed after the aristocratic system was overthrown.

This event was repeated again in January 1872 during the Meiji period when Emperor Meiji banned consumption of meat in Japan (Cwiertka, 24). The change in the Japanese diet was majorly influenced when the Europeans came into contact with the Japanese. The consumption of meat became a symbol of power, health, and strength which became a growing popular adoption for the Japanese which gave rise in their consumption of meat again including fish. Without these influences, sushi  wouldn’t have been part of the Japanese diet and later on part of the world diet. According to Cwiertka, “it will become evident that the multicultural character of contemporary Japanese cuisine is a result of specific circumstances in which Japan itself during the last 150 years, and the changes that have taken place under the impact of industrialization, nation-state formation and imperialist” (Cwiertka, 9). The contact meant the bringing of foreign culture in a new land. This means that there was a hybrid of Japanese-western cuisine that took place (Cwiertka, 21). One example of this instance can be seen with Tojo. Another instance of this Japanese westernized Japanese sushi is called the Nobu Style. Nobu-style means training as a sushi chef in Japan and also possessing knowledge in American cuisine. This creates a hybrid Americanized Japanese food and globalizing Japanese cuisine. Now Japanese restaurants and various other Asian restaurants serve Japanese dishes all around the world. 

Looking at cultural influences, in a way, sushi was able to be spread across Japan. Since China brought sushi to Japan, it became one of the cuisine that it identifies with. In addition, it is because of cultural influences that sushi became hybridized. This is because people share knowledge and also adapts to the culture of others. This includes immigration as well since it is one of the reasons why cuisines move because people move.
